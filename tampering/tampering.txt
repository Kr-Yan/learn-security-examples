Attackers can alter application inputs through tampering, which can result in unexpected behavior like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This occurs as a result of insufficient input sanitization, which permits the execution of malicious code in users' browsers. This is probably avoided by the secure version, which correctly sanitizes user inputs, escapes or encrypts special characters, and accepts or rejects inputs that could be harmful. By using this method, inputs are guaranteed not to be interpreted as executable code. Since tampering entails unauthorized data alteration, which jeopardizes the veracity and accuracy of the application's information, it primarily violates the CIA triad's Integrity property.
