- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Repudiation involves denying actions or transactions, creating accountability issues. A secure version employs non-repudiation techniques like digital signatures and detailed logging, providing undeniable evidence of user activities, making it superior for ensuring accountability. To further prevent such attacks, incorporating multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring additional verification, making unauthorized actions harder. Immutable logs prevent tampering, ensuring an accurate audit trail. Together, these mechanisms strengthen defenses against repudiation by creating a more robust and traceable system of user activity verification.
