Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerabilities mentioned are session hijacking and CSRF, arising from insecure handling of session cookies. The secure version mitigates these by implementing cookie flags: HttpOnly to block access from client-side scripts, preventing session cookie theft via XSS; Secure to ensure cookies are sent over HTTPS, protecting against interception; and SameSite to prevent cookies from being sent with cross-site requests, reducing CSRF risks. These measures enhance the application's security by safeguarding user sessions against unauthorized access and manipulation.
The main CIA triad violation caused by spoofing is the confidentiality component. An attacker can obtain sensitive information that should only be available to authorized people or entities by pretending to be another person or entity. Confidentiality is directly impacted by this unauthorized access, which jeopardizes the information's privacy and confidentiality.
